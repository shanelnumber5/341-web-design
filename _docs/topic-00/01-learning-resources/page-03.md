## Technologies
You are expected to utilize two main applications for this course:
1. A code editor, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_new">Visual Studio Code</a>, which are both free code editors, but there are many others that you are more than welcome to use. Our tutorial videos will be using Visual Studio Code.
2. Most Up-to-Date Browser - You should have at least one current version of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_new">Firefox</a> and/or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_new">Chrome</a>. <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_new">Safari</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" target="_new">Edge</a> are difficult to learn web development on, so you should utilize one of the other browsers for the remainder of this course.
